Bindings for Analog Devices ADGS1408/1409 8:1/Dual 4:1 Mux

Required properties:
- compatible : "adi,adgs1408" or "adi,adgs1409"
- #mux-control-cells : <0>
* Standard mux-controller bindings as described in mux-controller.txt

Optional properties:
- idle-state : if present, array of states that the mux controllers will have
  when idle. The special state MUX_IDLE_AS_IS is the default and
  MUX_IDLE_DISCONNECT is also supported.

States 0 through 7 correspond to signals S1 through S8 in the datasheet.

Example:

	/*
	 * One mux controller.
	 * Mux 1 to 8 set to idle as is (no idle-state declared)
	 */
	&spi0 {
		mux: mux-controller@2 {
			compatible = "adi,adgs1408";
			reg = <0>;
			spi-max-frequency = <1000000>;
			#mux-control-cells = <0>;
		};
	}

	adc-mux@3 {
		compatible = "io-channel-mux";
		io-channels = <&adc 1>;
		io-channel-names = "parent";
		mux-controls = <&mux>;

		channels = "out_a0", "out_a1", "test0", "test1",
			"out_b0", "out_b1", "testb0", "testb1";

	};
